:wave: I'm a dev at GitHub, currently working on the Discussions feature. :sparkles: I like building side projects for the games I play, e.g., [cheshire137/competiwatch-desktop](https://github.com/cheshire137/competiwatch-desktop) for tracking competitive Overwatch matches. I also love open data and civic APIs that I can build cool things from, e.g., [cheshire137/nash-grave-plot](https://github.com/cheshire137/nash-grave-plot) for easier data lookup about cemeteries in Nashville, TN.
